            <h1 class="pt-14 text-2xl">Our vision We envision a world where anyone, anywhere has the power to transform
                their lives through learning.</h1>

        </div>
        <div class=" text-blue-800 font-bold px-4 p-10">We believe
            Learning is the source of human progress.

            It has the power to transform our world
            from illness to health,
            from poverty to prosperity,
            from conflict to peace.

            It has the power to transform our lives
            for ourselves,
            for our families,
            for our communities.

            No matter who we are or where we are,
            learning empowers us to change and grow
            and redefine what’s possible.
            That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege.

            And that’s why Coursera is here.
            We partner with the best institutions
            to bring the best learning
            to every corner of the world.

            So that anyone, anywhere has the power to
            transform their lives through learning.</div>
